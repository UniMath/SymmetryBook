We'll start working on this bit:

* 1 Introduction [motivating examples]
  - Mathematical objects; no entity without identi(ty/fications)
  - Geometry and algebra united via symmetry (Erlangen Program)
  - Impossibility results: ruler+compass, root extraction
* 2 Mathematical objects and constructions
  - types, Σ, Π, =, U, ℕ, Fin, ×, →
  - constructions, pair, λ, idp, 0, successor, etc.
  - equivalences, h-levels, truncation, propositions, sets
  - logic, ∧, ∨, ∃, ∀, →
* 3 Groups
  - structure of identity types
  - automorphism 1-group = fundamental group (hint at higher groups)
  - homomorphisms induced by functions (early)
  - more examples: symmetric groups, integers, cyclic groups & modular arithmetic
  - group actions, orbits and fixed points
  - subgroups
  - Cayley's theorem
